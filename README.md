Hello all! ðŸ‘‹
This is my first website. It's really just to show my art.

My main goal of the page was:
- To keep the layout simplistic
- Give the user an overview of the kind of art I make
- Have the website match that aesthetic
- Incorporate some interactive elements
- Make the website responsive

My future plans and ideas for the website are:
- Make the website more accessible
- Add a page or feature to show any web features I've worked on (right now I don't have any)
- Add a shopping system, which allows you to purchase a painting 

Thanks for any feedback ðŸŒ¸
